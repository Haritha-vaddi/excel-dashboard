ðŸ“Š Excel Retail Dashboard Project
This project analyzes retail data using Excel from three datasets: Orders, People, and Returns. I cleaned the Orders dataset and used it to build pivot tables and charts. I created KPI cards using UNICHAR() codes to show key metrics like total sales, profit, and profitability. The dashboard includes visualizations such as doughnut and pie charts, and bar charts for top 5 and bottom 5 sales/profit. Slicers were added for interactive filtering across all visuals. This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard design in Excel.
